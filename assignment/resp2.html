          <p>
            <strong>Hello!</strong> Today we will be analyzing three books from the Our Little Cousin series. The series
            contains a set
            of 19th-century fictional allegories that portray racist cultural stereotypes of certain ethnicities or
            nationalities of people around the world to "educate" younger audiences on what the author believes to be
            these people's culture and traditions. In specific, the 3 books we'll be looking at today are <a
              target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43585">"Our Little
              Jewish Cousin,"</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46042">"Our Little Arabian
              Cousin,"</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44731"> "Nabul, Our Little
              Egyptian Cousin,"</a> all downloaded from
            Project Glutenburg. <em>Let's get to it...</em>
          </p>

          <h6 class="body-subtitle mt-4">Word occurences</h6>
          <p>
            After creating our corpus containing these three books, we ran a view of the most frequently occurring words
            in these texts with a stopword list to remove any commonly used words. To analyze word occurrences, we
            create a wordcloud in Rstudio and also display their frequencies to get a better understanding.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <div class="row mx-auto" style="width:76%;">
              <div class="col-5"><img class="body-image" style="width:100%" src="/images/resp2/1.png"></div>
              <div class="col-7"><img class="body-image" style="width:100%" src="/images/resp2/3.png"></div>
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              Left image contains word cloud of most frequent words, right contains another vizualization showing
              exact values of words and their occurences(n).
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>We see that George is one of the most frequently used. This is because George is one of the main characters
            in the Egyptian Cousin book, where he is depicted as an American visiting Egypt. We verify this by running a
            collocation on the word "George." We also see children are frequently mentioned, which makes sense since the
            book discusses children as that is their target audience. Another interesting word is "donkey." This is
            mentioned in every book, primarily in the Egyptian Cousin one. What might seem like an inaccurate depiction
            of Egypt is the fact that donkeys are mentioned as a more frequent form of transport than other Fauna such
            as camels (mentioned 50 times) or horses (mentioned 27 times), which were also quite common in Egypt at the
            time.
          </p>

          <h6 class="body-subtitle mt-4">Lets compare</h6>

              Comparison of words most commonly used and how its usage compares to other texts. The percentage indicates
              the frequency
              of usage out of all words used in each text.

          </figure>

          <p>
            From this visualization, we notice a couple distinctive word comparisons. We see that tents, camels, and
            horses are more frequently mentioned in the Arab book in comparison to the Egyptian book. The text tries to
            inaccurately connote that Arabs live mostly in the desert and in tents while Egypt has more infrastructure
            because the words 'built' or 'street' used more frequently in Egypt. An interesting note is the word "Al"
            which is used in the Arabic language appears more frequently in the Arab book when comparing to the Egyptian
            one. "Al" means "the" in Arabic and is commonly used to address objects or people in formal Arabic. It is
            usually used less frequently in Arabic dialects such as Egyptian Arabic, so that might explain the
            comparison. In comparison between Arabian Cousin and Jewish Cousin, we see Boston is more frequently
            mentioned in the Jewish Cousin book. This is possibly related to the fact that Boston is home to the <a
              target="_blank" href="https://www.brandeis.edu/cmjs/community-studies/boston-report.html"> fourth largest
              Jewish community in the United States.</a> We also see God is mentioned much more frequently in the
            Jewish book. This result is interesting considering religion also plays a big part in Arab culture and
            language, but God is mentioned only around 0.01% of the time in the Arab books. We run a concordance or
            contextual analysis in Voyant Tools on the word god in the Arabic and Jewish books:

          <p>
            We immediately see a significant amount of Zionist literature in the Jewish text claiming that it is the
            word of God to liberate the Jewish community from its cruel Egyptian Arab rulers. This allegory, although
            fictional, connotates that Jewish communities are oppressed by Arab rulers. Furthermore, the lack of
            religious representation of Islam in the Arab books, while a significant representation—although one would
            argue an innacurate one—of Jewish religion in the Jewish book could be used to reason that a bias exists
            in the texts
            through potentially favoring Judaism over Islam.

          <h6 class="body-subtitle mt-4">Concluding remarks</h6>
          <p>
            In conclusion, through the analysis of the Our Little Cousin series, we identify a political and
            stereotypical agenda to be read to children in the 1900s. We identified strange portrayals—mostly
            inaccurate—of Jewish and Arab communities through the common use of stereotypical names and their cultures
            and traditions.
