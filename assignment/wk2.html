        <h3>Assignment Task</h3>
        <p class="assignment">Response 1 (on your site) - see rubric and guidelines (due 9-20 September) Using AntConc,
          explore the Harry Potter fan fiction texts we worked with. What are you able to observe by looking at a list
          of words? How are they different from text to text? How can you use the concordance function, as well as the
          clusters / n-grams and collocation to gain insight into the different texts? Are there certain expressions
          which begin in Rowling and are popularized by fan fiction? What things seem to come about only in fan fiction?
          If you would like to try a corpus different from Harry Potter, try the corpora of African-American or colonial
          South Asian literature assembled by Amardeep Singh. You will have to figure out how to retrieve them from
          GitHub. Be sure to include illustrative visuals (screenshots) in your blog which allow your reader to follow
          your investigative process. </p>
        <h3 class="text-center mt-4 p-1">Analysis of HP Fan Fiction character topics</h2>
          <p><strong>Hello!</strong> In today's analysis we begin by trying to understand which characters are most
            commonly mentioned in
            HP(Harry Potter)
            fan fiction to juxtapose it to the original J.K. Rowling HP books. We're going to also analyze how these
            characters interact and are portrayed in comparison to the originals.
            This will allow us to make interpretations on which characters are most favored by the community and for
            what reasons.
          </p>

          <p>To analyze word occurances, we're going to be using the AntConc ngram feature and feed it a giant list of
            names gathered from harry potter and sources online. <em>Let's get to it...</em></p>

          <h6 class="body-subtitle">Character occurances</h6>
          <p>
            To get names of all the characters in the book series, we copied this csv file from <a class=""
              target="_blank"
              href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/efekarakus/potter-network/master/data/characters.csv">here.</a>
            We extracted all the frist names and added a few last names that are commonly used in Harry Potter such as
            Dumbledore and Snape.
            We now put all those values and feed it into our word list search, by going to <em>Tool preferences -> Word
              List -> Load file</em> and adding our csv file to load our list of names. We get the following
            results for the fan fiction texts, where frequencies are <em>harry > severus > hemione > ron >
              dumbledore</em> for the
            fan fiction.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div class="row mx-auto" style="width:76%;">
              <div class="col-6"><img class="body-image" src="/images/ass1/img2"></div>
              <div class="col-6"><img class="body-image" src="/images/ass1/img4.png"></div>
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              Harry potter fan fiction word list
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>We then load the original Rowling texts:</p>

          <figure>
            <div class="row mx-auto" style="width:76%;">
              <div class="col-12"><img class="body-image" style="width:60%" src="/images/ass1/img1.png"></div>
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              Rowling originals word list
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            For the Rowling texts we see that the order of frequency for the top 5 is
            <em>harry > ron > hermione > dumbledore > snape.</em>
            We can see that Severus is more popularized in fan fiction as its the second most commonly used name. Even
            if we add Severus Snape's frequency for first
            and last name it doesnt even reach top 4 in Rowling's texts. So we conclude that Severus seems to be a fan
            favorite but was more underepresented in
            the originals. But why is Severus Snape more popular, to find out lets see how he's used in context of the
            fan fiction Corpus.
          </p>



          <h6 class="body-subtitle">Characters and their contexts</h6>
          <p>
            Before anything lets brush up on who some important characters are based off forums:</p>
          <ul class="text-left px-0 mx-3 my-1">
            <li>
              <em>Whos is Sirius?</em> In short Sirius Black is a good friend of Harry Potter and his father and set
              against
              the Antogonist Voldemort through a group called Order of the Pheonix. <a target="_blank"
                href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Sirius_Black"> Click here for more.</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Who is Severus?</em> Severus Snape is a master of the dark arts and had originally part of the Death
              Eaters
              - a group pledging allegiance to the antognist Lord Voldemort - before switching sides to the Order of The
              Pheonix following
              the murder of a woman he loved named Lily by Lord Voldemort. He had become strongly loyal to <a
                target="_blank" href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a>
              to the extent of killing him at his own request. He had eventually died fighting Lord Voldemort, this
              could potentially be a reason as to why viewers liked Severus so much, as he had
              died avenging a woman he loved.
            </li>

            <li>
              I also suggest you do a quick reading on some more characters in the text and the general plot of the
              Harry Potter book series
              <a target="_blank" href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki"> here.</a>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So now that we brushed up on some characters, lets begin by running collocation and concordance on words
            'Severus' and 'Snape' in fan fiction
            to get some context:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div class="row mx-auto w-75">
              <div class="col-12"><img class="body-image" style="width:60%" src="/images/ass1/img5.png"></div>
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              Collocation on the word Severus
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>In this list we find some interesting collocated words, lets look at those that include human names to see
            how Severus is viewed interacting with
            other characters in fan fiction. We find that 'Brenda' and 'Dumbledore' are the most prominent names, so we
            run a concordance on those words with
            Snape by clicking on them. We will also take a look at 'grandfather' as its endearing tone might hint
            towards why Snape is loved so greatly in the
            community.
          </p>

              <span class="visually-hidden">Next</span>
            </button>
          </div>

          <p> So, from a look of concordance with the words Grandpa and Snape, we see that most of these occurances of
            portraying Snape as an endearing grandfather is by DramaGirl. Which from a quick look at concordance with
            Snape and Brenda, we see Dramagirl's plot is meant to be a fictional spin-off of Harry Potter where Harry
            Potter is now a girl named Brenda Potter. This is verified through a quick look at the corpus mentioning a
            "Ms. Potter." We also see a strong relationship built on trust between Dumbledore and Snape, which matches
            the originals. From this, we see Snape as a loving and heartbroken man. From him being portrayed as a loving
            grandpa, taking care of Ms. Potter to spying for Dumbledore in 'Witchdragon_dragonheart'. This could
            potentially mean that fan fiction writers resonated with the loss of Snape's beloved Lily in the originals
            so much that they decided to portray his chivalrous, protaganistic behavior in their works. One might argue
            that specific fan fiction might mention Severus too much and it is not an accurate representation of the
            community. So the last slide contains a Concordance plot to investigate the distribution of his name. The
            plot shows that 7 of the 12 texts mentioned Snape at least once, which is more than half of the texts in our
            dictionary. This shows that the distribution is quite spread out across texts and not skewed drastically due
            to simply one text.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, from a distant reading and analysis of a selection of Harry Potter FF texts, we conclude that
            Snape is more favored in the community than Rowling might've expected. We've discussed potential reasons for
            this. The main being that the community had included him in their stories to finally give a happy ending to
            Severus Snape, in contrast to the original, where he dies a heartbroken man while fighting his lover's
            killer- Lord Voldemort.
