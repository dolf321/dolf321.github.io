        <p class="assignment">Assignment 1 (due 7-27 October) see the rubrics and guidelines. Use one of the already
          downloaded corpora from AntCorGen or Follow the steps to download AntCorGen described in the video above to
          download your own. Use AntConc to analyze the corpus that you have created. What are the most common words?
          specialized words? clusters? collocations? Are there groups of articles with common trends? Did your results
          match your hypotheses? Feel free to use Antconc or Voyant tools for your analysis, but be aware that it is
          more difficult to use Voyant with many documents at a time. </p>

        <h3 class="text-center mt-4 p-1">Analysis of PLOS ONE "Military" Corpus</h2>
          <p><strong>Hello,</strong> today we'll generating a Corpus containing any occurances of the word military,
            then running an analysis on what specific topics are refered to in the text.
          </p>

          <p>
            We first generate the corpora using AntCorGen and query for any occurances of the word "military" as
            follows:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div class="row mx-auto" style="width:76%;">
              <div class="col-12"><img class="body-image" style="width:80%" src="/images/ass2/1.png"></div>
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              AntCorGen corpus creation.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>To analyze word occurances, we're going to be using the Voyant wordcloud feature to get a general
            understanding
            of the text, we will then see in what contexts they're used to get an idea of the topics dicussed. <em>Let's
              get to it...</em></p>

          <h6 class="body-subtitle">Getting context</h6>
          <figure>
            <div class="row mx-auto" style="width:76%;">

          </figure>

          <p>
            We see some interesting and frequent words used are: <em>military, risk, health, study.</em> From this we
            assume the Corpus contains a lot of studies discussing health risks of working in the Defense industry. To
            verify this we
            need some more context, so we run a concordance on the word <em>risk</em>. Lets also run a concordance on
            the word
            <em>military</em> to understand the corpus better.
          </p>

          <p>As expected we see the word risk being used to identify health impact on military troops, through
            a closer look we see a lot of articles discussing respiratory diseases and tuberculosis, possibly due to
            smoking addiction across soldiers. We also notice something very interesting from concordance on the word
            Military,
            we see a lot of mention of specific countries and regions. Which contries are mentioned most frequently and
            why? We answer this through generating a word list that searches for a set of specific words.
          </p>

          <h6 class="body-subtitle">Which militaries and why?</h6>
          <p>We download a set of countries and their acronyms from <a target="_blank"
              href="https://pkgstore.datahub.io/core/country-list/data_csv/data/d7c9d7cfb42cb69f4422dec222dbbaa8/data_csv.csv">
              here. </a>We use this data to generate a set of search terms that we put in the advanced option of our
            clusters tool and run
            a cluster analysis to determine which phrases or countries are more frequently mentioned. It is likely
            that the most mentioned contries would be those with large militaries are those that have partaken in
            popular wars.

            <div class="row mx-auto" style="width:90%;">

          <p>We immidiately realize that acronyms seem to be top, which is abnormal. But through running a concordance
            on some of
            the most frequently used acronyms we notice that they are being used in the context of units. An example
            being CI,
            which is being used as the unit Curie and not the country Côte d'Ivoire in all cases. As such, lets ignore
            units that might be mistaken for countries and only look at country phrases when ranking the most mentioned
            countries. With this in mind we recognize the most frequently mentioned
            countries are <em>China, USA, Iraq, Peru, and Thailand</em> in that order from highest to lowest. Why are
            these countries
            mentioned
            frequently? Peru especially stands out as it hasn't had a war since 1995 and is ranked 50 in Military
            Strength;
            perhaps Peru is not mentioned in the context of its military but something else. To investigate we run a
            concordance on the word <em>Peru</em>. We also investigate why China is mentioned more than the US and on
            what
            specific topics through running a concordance on the word <em>China</em>.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <div class="row mx-auto" style="width:90%;">

          <p>
            From the concordance we determine China and Peru are mentioned almost entirely due to viral outbreaks in
            their regions.
            One of the main reason Peru is the most frequently mentioned is because Peru is currently dealing with an
            epidemic
            cased by a mosquito-borne viral disease known as <a target="_blank"
              href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dengue-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20353078#:~:text=Dengue%20(DENG%2Dgey)%20fever,fever%20and%20flu%2Dlike%20symptoms.">
              Dengue.</a> An example of this is in a paper that discusses preventative measures such as installing
            insecticide treated curtains in
            Peruvian homes, we discover this through a combination of concordance and file view. Running a concordance
            for Peru in the context of the word
            military reveals that articles are solely discuss disease outbreaks and their affect on military troops
            stationed in Jungles and not a comparison of world powers. This is mainly due to the fact a large majority
            of articles published in he PLOS journals are in Epidemiology and Medicine according to their <a target="_blank" href="https://plos.org/publish/publishing-faqs/"> FAQ.</a>
          </p>

          <figure>
            <div class="row mx-auto" style="width:90%;">
              <div class="col-8 mx-auto"><img class="body-image" src="/images/ass2/plos.png"></div>
            </div>
          </figure>

          <p>In conclusion, we discovered the corpus discusses the affects of mostly tropical diseases in certain regions and their affect on military personel stationed
            in those regions. This can be expected considering the topics published in the PLOS one journals. The reason China and Peru are 
            frequently mentioned in these articles could be simply due to the fact that there is a larger spread of disease in those regions.
