        <p class="assignment">Assignment 1 (due 7-27 October) see the rubrics and guidelines. Use one of the already
          downloaded corpora from AntCorGen or Follow the steps to download AntCorGen described in the video above to
          download your own. Use AntConc to analyze the corpus that you have created. What are the most common words?
          specialized words? clusters? collocations? Are there groups of articles with common trends? Did your results
          match your hypotheses? Feel free to use Antconc or Voyant tools for your analysis, but be aware that it is
          more difficult to use Voyant with many documents at a time. </p>

        <h3 class="text-center mt-4 p-1">Analysis of PLOS ONE "Military" Corpus</h2>
          <p><strong>Hello,</strong> today we'll be creating a Corpus containing any occurences of the word military,
            then running an analysis on what specific topics are referred to in the text. We search for articles
            mentioning
            the military to get a further understanding on what topics and why those topics are mentioned by the most
            frequently
            mentioned countries.

          </p>

          <p>
            We first generate the corpora using AntCorGen and query for any occurences of the word "military" as
            follows:
          </p>

              AntCorGen corpus creation.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>To analyze word occurances, we're going to be using the Voyant wordcloud feature to get a general
            understanding
            of the text, we will then see in what contexts they're used to get an idea of the topics discussed. <em>Let's
              get to it...</em></p>

          <p>
            We see some interesting and frequent words used are: <em>military, risk, health, study.</em> From this we
            assume the Corpus contains a lot of studies discussing health risks of working in the Defense industry. To
            verify this we
            need some more context, so we run a concordance on the word <em>risk</em>. Let's also run a concordance on
            the word
            <em>military</em> to understand the corpus better.

          <p>As expected, we see the word 'risk' being used to identify health impact on military troops. Through
            a closer look we notice articles discussing respiratory diseases and tuberculosis, possibly due to
            smoking addiction across soldiers. We also notice something very interesting from concordance on the word
            Military,
            we see a lot of mention of specific countries and regions. Which countries are mentioned most frequently and
            why? We answer this through generating a word list that searches for a set of specific words.
          </p>

          <h6 class="body-subtitle">Which militaries and why?</h6>
          <p>We download a set of countries and their acronyms from <a target="_blank"
              href="https://pkgstore.datahub.io/core/country-list/data_csv/data/d7c9d7cfb42cb69f4422dec222dbbaa8/data_csv.csv">
              here. </a>We use this data to generate a set of search terms that we put in the advanced option of our
            clusters tool and run
            a cluster analysis to determine which phrases or countries are more frequently mentioned. It is likely
            that the most mentioned countries would be those with large militaries are those that have partaken in
            popular wars.

          <p>We immediately realize that acronyms seem to be top, which is abnormal. But through running a concordance
            on some of
            the most frequently used acronyms, we notice that they are being used in the context of units. An example
            being CI,
            which is being used as the unit Curie and not the country Côte d'Ivoire in all cases. As such, let's ignore
            units that might be mistaken for countries and only look at country phrases when ranking the most mentioned
            countries. With this in mind we recognize the most frequently mentioned
            countries are <em>China, USA, Iraq, Peru, and Thailand</em> in that order from highest to lowest. Why are
            these countries
            mentioned
            frequently? Peru especially stands out as it hasn't had a war since 1995 and is ranked 50 in Military
            Strength;
            perhaps Peru is not mentioned in the context of its military but something else. To investigate, we run a
            concordance on the word <em>Peru</em>. We also investigate why China is mentioned more than the US and on
            what
            specific topics through running a concordance on the word <em>China</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            From the concordance we determine China and Peru are mentioned a lot partly due to viral outbreaks in their
            regions. One of the main reason Peru is the most frequently mentioned is that it's currently dealing with an
            epidemic cased by a mosquito-borne viral disease known as <a target="_blank"
              href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dengue-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20353078#:~:text=Dengue%20(DENG%2Dgey)%20fever,fever%20and%20flu%2Dlike%20symptoms.">
              Dengue.</a> An example of this is in a paper that
            discusses preventative measures such as installing insecticide treated curtains in Peruvian homes, we
            discover this through a combination of concordance and file view. Running a concordance for Peru in the
            context of the word military reveals that articles are solely discuss disease outbreaks and their effect on
            military troops stationed in Jungles, and not a comparison of world powers. This might be due to the fact a
            large majority of articles published in the PLOS journals are in Epidemiology and Medicine, according to
            their <a target="_blank" href="https://plos.org/publish/publishing-faqs/"> FAQ.</a>

          <h6 class="body-subtitle">Let's talk politics</h6>
          <p>
            Epidemiology is a big playing factor in China, being mentioned frequently. But is political bias influencing
            the context in which China is being mentioned? To analyze this, we run a collocation on China and juxtapose
            it to the USA. India is also another global disease hotspot according to <a target="_blank"
              href="https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/2017/10/global-disease-hotspots-2-0#:~:text=Places%20like%20Bangladesh%2C%20India%2C%20and,populated%20countries%20in%20the%20world.">
              this article here.</a> As such, we also
            check the context in which India is mentioned to see if it's also mentioned in the context of disease like
            China.

          <p>
            We see from our Collocation on 'China' that the words mentioned mostly are regions, viruses, and diseases.
            This greatly contrasts to the context in which India is mentioned: which the corpus discuss topics such as
            the country's wildlife and politics with the UAE, but rarely any diseases. This result is strange, as
            they're both disease hotspots. But the difference might be explained by the simple fact that there's much
            more Epidemiological research in China than India, according to <a target="_blank"
              href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-06-16/us-leads-world-in-scientific-research-output-but-dominance-shrinking-study">
              this article.</a> From our collocation on 'USA'
            we see studies on lawmakers, marginalized groups due to the word 'Transgender', and discussion of migrant
            worker health in the states. Strangely enough, we see very little mention of disease, although the US
            contains more publications in Epidemiology and is rated the most productive country in research according
            to<a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.720787/full">
              this paper.</a> This might be because the study of disease requires on-site research, which would explain
            discussing Chinese viral research. However, that does not justify the lack of papers on disease in India. As
            such, this might be a sign of political bias through portraying China as a disease ridden country and not
            other nearby regions.

          </p>
          <h6 class="body-subtitle">Key points</h6>
          <p>In conclusion, we discovered the corpus discusses the effects of mostly tropical diseases in certain
            regions and sometimes their effect on military personnel stationed in those regions. This can be expected considering
            the topics published in the PLOS one journals. The reason China and Peru are frequently mentioned in these
            articles could be simply due to the fact that there is a larger spread of disease in those regions. However,
            there might be signs of political bias through the fact that China is mentioned more frequently than other
            disease filled countries such as India and Peru.
